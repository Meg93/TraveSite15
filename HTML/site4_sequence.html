                     <p class="body"> It’s fitting that harbourside Helsinki, capital of a country with such watery
                        geography, melds so graciously into the Baltic. Half the city seems liquid, and
                        the writhings of the complex coastline include any number of bays, inlets and
                        islands. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="body"> Though Helsinki can seem a younger sibling to other Scandinavian capitals, it’s
                        the one that went to art school, scorns pop music and works in a cutting-edge
                        studio. The design scene here is legendary, whether you're browsing showroom
                        brands or taking the backstreet hipster trail. The city's gourmet side is also
                        flourishing, with new gastro eateries offering locally sourced tasting menus
                        popping up at dizzying speed. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="body"> Nevertheless, much of what is lovable in Helsinki is older. Its understated yet
                        glorious art-nouveau buildings, the spacious elegance of its centenarian cafes,
                        dozens of museums carefully preserving Finnish heritage, restaurants that have
                        changed neither menu nor furnishings since the 1930s: all part of the city’s
                        quirky charm.

                        By Andy Symington, Writer: 
                        My first impression of Finland was a winter one, when snow-hushed forests and
                        Christmastime conviviality made an instant impact. You must come back in summer,
                        everyone said, so I did, for midnight daytime saunas by impossibly picturesque
                        lakes and melt-in-the-mouth fresh berries and potatoes. Fresh air, the Lapland
                        wilderness, the hiking, the wildlife: it's a natural wonderland within an
                        impressively technological modern nation. The real bonus? The Finns, who do
                        their own thing and are much the better for it. Independent, loyal and welcoming
                        – memorable people in an inspirational country. Make it your business to get to
                        know some.

                        City Lights 
                        Don’t get the idea that the country’s just a backwoods emptiness, though.
                        Vibrant cities stock the southern parts, headed by the capital, Helsinki, a
                        cutting-edge urban space with world-famous design and music scenes. Embraced by
                        the Baltic, it’s an enticing ensemble of modern and stately architecture, island
                        restaurants, and stylish and quirky bars. And complaints about Finnish food are
                        so last century: the ‘new Suomi’ restaurant scene is kicking, with locally
                        foraged flavours to the fore.

                        Call of the Wild 
                        The Finland you encounter will depend on the season of your visit, but whatever
                        the month, the call of the wilderness is a siren song not to be resisted.
                        There’s something pure in the Finnish air and spirit that’s really vital and
                        exciting; it’s an invitation to get out and active year-round. With vast tracts
                        of forest, speckled by picture-perfect lakes as if an artist had flicked a blue
                        paintbrush at the map, Suomi offers some of Europe’s best hiking, kayaking and
                        canoeing. A fabulous network of national parks has well-marked routes and
                        regularly spaced huts for overnighting. Bears and elk deep in the forests can be
                        observed on nature-watching trips.

                        Summer Days 
                        Finland’s short but reliable sunny season sees the country burst into life.
                        Finns seem to want to suck every last golden drop out of the summer in the hope
                        that it will last them through the long dark winter months, and there’s an
                        explosion of good cheer and optimism. It’s a time for music festivals, art
                        exhibitions, lake cruises, midnight sunshine on convivial beer terraces, lazy
                        days at remote waterside cottages and mouth-watering market produce.
